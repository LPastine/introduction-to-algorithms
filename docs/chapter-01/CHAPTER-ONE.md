# Chapter 1 - The Role of Algorithms in Computing

## 1.1 Algorithms

An **algorithm** is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values,
as **input** and produces some value, or set of values, as **output** in a finite amount of time.

An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output.

You can view an algorithm as a tool for solving a well-specified **computational problem**.

An **instance of a problem** consists of the input needed to compute a solution to the problem.

An algorithm for a computational problem is **correct** if, for every problem instance provided
as input, it **halts** - finishes its computing in finite time - and outputs the correct solution
to the problem of the instance. A correct algorithm **solves** the given computational problem.

### Data Structures

A **data structure** is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and 
modifications. Using the appropriate data structure or structures is an important part of 
algorithm design. No single data structure works well for all purposes, and so you should know
the strengths and limitations of several of them.
